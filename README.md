## TCP Flood Script

This Python script is a simple example of how a TCP flood attack might be created. This attack is not a very
effective version as it requires the target to have less bandwidth than the attacking computer. As it only
allows for a single attacking IP address, it would be very easy to create a firewall rule blocking such
traffic from an attacker using this script.

This was made for a computer networking class as an example of how easy it is to create simple network-based DOS attacks.

### Disclaimer
Please use this script responsibly. Pointing this at an IP:port combination you don't have permission to is
is most certainly illegal and can be *very* easily traced.
